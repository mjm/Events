/// The EventSink protocol allows you to control where your events go when you call `EventBuilder.send(_:_:)`. The Events package provides
/// a default EventSink that turns events into formatted log messages and logs them with `os_log`, but you could also send your events to a web
/// service or save them in a database for querying.
///
/// - Warning: Be careful about privacy if you send your events off-device. You should avoid including data in your events that could be considered
///   personally identifiable information (PII).
public protocol EventSink {
    /// Send an event to its destination.
    ///
    /// The implementation of this method should encode the event as necessary and then send or store it as appropriate for the sink. There is no way
    /// to report progress, success, or failure for sending the event. If you need to account for these, that should be contained within your implementation
    /// of this method. Your app will treat sending events as a "fire and forget" system.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///    - event: The event that needs to be encoded and sent.
    ///    - level: The log level that the event is being sent at. Not all sinks will have use for this parameter, so you may ignore it if it doesn't make
    ///      sense for your sink. While the parameter is an `OSLogType`, it's completely valid for the destination to be somewhere other than `os_log`.

///
/// - Remark: `os_log` is not actually a particularly good destination for structured, high-cardinality events. The unified logging system doesn't have any
///   understanding of the structure, so you can't do sophisticated queries against your fields, and we have to circumvent the privacy protections that the system
///   has for dynamic values, since we render the entire log string dynamically. The main thing `os_log` has going for it is that it is easily available since it is the
